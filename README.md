# **HR ANALYTICS PROJECT (USING SQL AND POWER BI)**

The objective of this HR analysis is to gain insights into workforce dynamics by:

1. Summarizing Key HR Metrics: Analyze essential data points, such as total headcount and attrition rates, to understand workforce stability.
2. Examining Employee Distribution and Attrition Rates: Visualize the correlation between workforce distribution across various categories and their impact on attrition.
3. Analyzing Employee Feedback: Evaluate job satisfaction and performance feedback to identify areas for improvement and enhance retention efforts.
4. Conducting HR Cohort Analysis: Track recruitment and turnover patterns monthly for 2018 and 2019, focusing on understanding turnover causes and trends over time.
This analysis aims to leverage data-driven insights for strategic workforce management and improved employee retention.

## **Dashboard Components**

1. Overview of Key HR Metrics: A summary that highlights essential HR data points, including total headcount, active employees, attrition counts, and attrition rate, offering a snapshot of workforce stability and movement.
2. Employee Distribution vs. Attrition Rate: Visual analysis of how the workforce is distributed across various categories—such as branches, age groups, job roles, departments, gender, and business travel—and correlating these factors with the attrition rate to uncover trends.
3. Employee Feedback Analysis: A deep dive into employee performance, job satisfaction, and work-life balance, using feedback data to identify key areas that need improvement to help reduce turnover and enhance retention efforts.
4. HR Cohort: Tracking Employee Recruitment and Turnover on a Monthly Basis in 2018 and 2019: Cohort analysis in HR helps organizations monitor the recruitment and turnover patterns of employees, enabling the assessment of workforce trends over specific periods.
   + Determine the number of employees who left the organization each month during these years.
   + Compare months with high and low turnover rates to identify potential underlying causes (e.g., peak recruitment seasons or lack of motivation during the year-end months).
